title: Kubernetes Distribution
description: Analyzing the Kubernetes distribution that's running
---

The `distribution` analyzer is used to check for known managed (hosted) and self-hosted versions of Kubernetes.
The `when` attribute supports standard comparators to compare the result to.

The `distribution` analyzer uses the data collected in the [clusterResources](https://troubleshoot.sh/collect/cluster-resources) is included in the support bundle.
The `clusterResources` collector is automatically added and will always be present.
